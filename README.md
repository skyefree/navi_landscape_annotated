# navi_landscape_annotated
Welcome to the Na’vi Annotated Landscape project, where an image of the Na'vi landscape has been annotated with language and cultural information.

To view the prototype in your browser, you will need to download the project files:

On the repository main page you will see the list of files. Click the “code” button at the top and select “download ZIP.” Once the ZIP folder has been downloaded, you will need to extract all files. Then you can open the htm file locally on your browser to see the annotated image in web view. You can also take a look at the other files, including the css, javascript, xml, and xsl files. 

When you open the htm file in your browser, you will see that to the right of the image is the list of annotations sorted by category. You can scroll over the image to see the annotations or you can select from list on the right. 

There are five categories and each one is displayed using a different colour.

To see an annotation, you can click on the box or on the list. To zoom in on an annotated area of the image, double click on the annotation box. Click again to zoom out.
